# LangGraph Agentic Workflow Use Cases

This repository contains 3 Python scripts and a Streamlit application demonstrating various use cases built with LangGraph Studio.

## Scripts

* **`blog_evaluater_optimizer.py`**: Evaluates and optimizes blog content. Run using: `python blog_evaluater_optimizer.py`
* **`code_peer_review_parallel.py`**: Performs parallel code peer reviews. Run using: `python code_peer_review_parallel.py`
* **`learning_path_orchestrator.py`**: Orchestrates learning paths. Run using: `python learning_path_orchestrator.py`

Note: These scripts utilize LangGraph Studio to debug workflows.

## Streamlit Application

* **`app7.py`**: A Streamlit interface that integrates the use cases from the above scripts, providing a user-friendly way to interact with them. Run using: `streamlit run app7.py`

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required dependencies (refer to `requirements.txt`).
3.  **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:**
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
    ```
4.  Run the desired script using the commands provided above.
5.  To run the Streamlit application, execute `streamlit run app7.py`.

## Notes

* The scripts were initially developed for evaluating and finalizing use cases using LangGraph Studio.
* The Streamlit application provides a unified interface for these use cases.

## Detailed Workflow Overviews

### Blog Generation App with Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow
![alt text](assets/image-1.png)

#### Overview
This project implements an **Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow** using **LangGraph** and **LangChain** to generate and refine short blogs. The workflow follows an iterative process where an LLM generates a blog, evaluates it against predefined criteria, and either accepts it or provides feedback for revision. This ensures that the final output meets quality standards.

#### Why This Workflow Works
The **Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow** is effective because it automates content generation while maintaining **quality control** through an LLM-powered evaluation loop. If the initial blog meets the set criteria (**concise, engaging, structured with subtitles and a conclusion**), it is accepted. Otherwise, the LLM provides feedback, and the blog is regenerated with improvements.

#### Features
- **Automated Blog Generation**: Generates a blog based on a given topic.
- **Evaluation & Feedback**: Reviews the blog for conciseness, structure, and entertainment value.
- **Iterative Refinement**: If the blog needs revision, feedback is provided, and a revised version is generated.
- **LangSmith Studio Integration**: Visualizes and tests workflow execution.

#### Testing in LangSmith Studio
- Deploy the workflow and **provide only the topic** as input.
- Monitor execution flow and **validate outputs** by logging into your LangSmith account (Adding @traceable to your function helps track it)
- You can also test via "Langraph dev" command on your console which will open up Studio for enhanced debugging (ensure you have the langgraph.json file for this and customize it for your project)

### Code Review App with Parallelization Workflow
![alt text](assets/image-2.png)

#### Introduction
This project demonstrates a **parallelized workflow** for **automated code review** using **large language models (LLMs)**. Instead of running feedback checks sequentially, the system executes multiple review processes **in parallel**, making it an **efficient and scalable** solution for code assessment.

#### Why Parallelization?
- **Faster Execution:** Multiple feedback checks run **simultaneously**, reducing the overall processing time.
- **Improved Scalability:** New review criteria can be added without significant slowdowns.
- **Better Resource Utilization:** Leverages LLM calls efficiently by distributing tasks.

#### Features
- **Readability Analysis**: Evaluates the clarity and structure of the code.
- **Security Review**: Identifies potential vulnerabilities.
- **Best Practices Compliance**: Checks adherence to industry-standard coding best practices.
- **Feedback Aggregation**: Combines results into a single, structured response.

#### How It Works
1. A **code snippet** is provided as input.
2. Three independent LLM processes analyze the snippet for:
   - Readability
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Best practices adherence
3. The results from these processes are aggregated into a final feedback report.
 
#### Testing in LangSmith Studio
- Deploy the workflow and **provide only the topic** as input.
- Monitor execution flow and **validate outputs** by logging into your LangSmith account (Adding @traceable to your function helps track it)
- You can also test via "Langraph dev" (ensure you have the langgraph.json file for this)

### Learning Path Generator App with Orchestrator-Synthesizer Workflow
![alt text](assets/image-3.png)

#### Overview
This project implements an **Orchestrator-Synthesizer** workflow to dynamically generate a personalized **learning roadmap** based on a user's existing skills and learning goals. It uses **LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq AI models** to generate structured study plans and topic summaries.

#### Why Orchestrator-Synthesizer?
The **Orchestrator-Synthesizer** pattern is ideal for structured content generation workflows where tasks need to be dynamically assigned, processed independently, and then combined into a final output. It differs from traditional parallelization in the following ways:
- **Orchestration** dynamically determines what needs to be processed, ensuring relevant tasks are executed based on user input.
- **Workers** independently generate content summaries for each topic in the study plan.
- **Synthesis** intelligently merges topic summaries into a well-structured learning roadmap.

#### Workflow Breakdown
The workflow consists of three key components:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Orchestrator
- Creates a **study plan** based on the user's **skills and learning goals**.
- Uses an LLM with a structured output schema to generate a list of **learning topics**.

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Workers
- Each **worker** processes an individual **learning topic**.
- Generates a **markdown-formatted content summary** for the topic, including key concepts and learning resources.

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Synthesizer
- Collects all **topic summaries** and organizes them into a **cohesive learning roadmap**.
- Ensures smooth flow and structured representation of the learning journey.

#### Code Structure
- `orchestrator(state: State)`: Generates the study plan dynamically.
- `llm_call(state: WorkerState)`: Summarizes a single topic.
- `synthesizer(state: State)`: Merges all topic summaries into the final roadmap.
- `assign_workers(state: State)`: Dynamically assigns tasks based on generated topics.

#### Running the Workflow
To generate a personalized learning path, the workflow takes the following inputs:
```python
user_skills = "Python programming, basic machine learning concepts"
user_goals = "Learn advanced AI, master prompt engineering, and build AI applications"
```

It then executes the **Orchestrator ‚Üí Workers ‚Üí Synthesizer** pipeline, producing a structured learning roadmap.
